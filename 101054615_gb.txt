WHO WAS GEORGE BROWN?
George Brown (1818-1880) was a 19th century Scottish-born Canadian politician, newspaper publisher (he founded The Globe, precursor to The Globe and Mail) and was one of the Fathers of Confederation. An essential figure in the formation of Canada, Brown was a strong believer in public education.

In 1967, Canada’s centennial year, Bill Davis, then the Ontario Minister of Education, suggested that George Brown College would be a suitable name for the new college of applied arts and technology, noting: “the city to which George Brown added such lustre as a reformer, journalist, and statesman should honour him in this way.”


EVOLUTION, EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT:
George Brown College opened its doors in 1968, welcoming just over 2,000 students. In addition to programs in construction, early childhood education, dental services and the culinary arts – subjects we continue to teach – we once offered programs that might not be quite as relevant today, like sign writing or watchmaking. Believe it or not, we even prepared students for careers at sea through a marine engineering program.

Since then, our student population has grown to nearly 30,000. People come to George Brown from across the Greater Toronto Area, the country and the world to develop the skills and gain the real-world experience needed to succeed in the workplace.

Since 2004, under current President Anne Sado’s leadership, George Brown has more than doubled in size, broadened our international partnerships and increased our commitment to strengthening the cultural, economic and social fabric of Toronto.

MILESTONES:
George Brown opened in 1968, but our history stretches back to the early 1950s with the formation of two provincial organizations that later amalgamated to form the college.


1950S – LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE:

1951
The Department of Education creates the Provincial Institute of Trades and transfers to it, from the Ryerson Institute of Technology, all the apprenticeship training in designated trades offered through the Department of Labour.

1952
The Provincial Institute of Trades opens at 21 Nassau St., in the heart of Kensington Market. Charles Emery is appointed its first principal.

1952-1957
The need for space leads to the construction of two additional buildings in Kensington Market. Students made a significant contribution to the construction by using the projects as field placements.


1960S – THE CREATION OF GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE:

1961
The Provincial Institute of Trades starts broadening its program selection by including courses in lathing and structural steel, barbering, diesel mechanics, jewellery arts, watchmaking and welding.

The college begins operations on March 1 with 2,009 students and 187 instructors spread across five buildings on two campuses: the Dartnell Campus, near Casa Loma, and the Nassau Street Campus in Kensington Market.

Overcrowding is an immediate concern – with some programs forced to run in three shifts, from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. – and the search begins for additional space.

1969
The College Street Campus (507 College St.) opens and George Brown integrates 4,000 students and staff from four Adult Training Centres (ATC). The College Street ATC initially offered academic upgrading, commercial courses and the rapidly expanding ESL program. Over the next two years, the curriculum expanded to include programs such as nursery aid, dressmaking and alterations, pattern making and design, commercial art, sign writing, offset printing, furniture refinishing and repair, retail merchandising and a large truck driver training program.


1970S – CAMPUS EXPANSION WITH CASA LOMA AND ST. JAMES LOCATIONS:

1973
George Brown adds a sprawling new building at 160 Kendal Ave. The newly renamed Casa Loma Campus offers programs in construction, computer systems and networks, jewellery making and dance. The campus was originally intended to provide programs with a technology and applied arts focus.

Five hospital nursing schools were merged under the George Brown College umbrella: Toronto General Hospital, St. Michael’s Hospital, St. Joseph’s Hospital, the Atkinson School of Nursing (at Toronto Western Hospital), and Nightingale School of Nursing.

1976
St. James Campus opens at 200 King St. E. with programs in business, community services, deaf and deafblind studies and work/college preparation, integrating George Brown in the fabric of Toronto’s downtown core.

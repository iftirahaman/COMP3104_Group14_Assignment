The DevOps methodology is the newcomer to the SDLC scene.
It emerged from two trends: the application of Agile and Lean practices to operations work,
and the general shift in business toward seeing the value of collaboration between development and operations staff at all stages of the SDLC process.

Continuous integration is a coding philosophy and set of practices that drive development teams to implement small changes and check in code to version control repositories frequently.
Because most modern applications require developing code in different platforms and tools, the team needs a mechanism to integrate and validate its changes.

CI/CD is one of the best practices for devops teams to implement.
It is also an agile methodology best practice, as it enables software development teams to focus on meeting business requirements, code quality, and security because deployment steps are automated.

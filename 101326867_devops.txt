This course is designed to better prepare professionals entering the IT field.
Specifically, a field where servers, web apps and infrastructure will be core to business needs.
COMP 3104 will provide a hands-on experience through the implementation of tried, tested and true DevOps technologies.

Using DevOps practices effectively will allow for a process predicated on ease to ship code to Production servers, apply hot-fixes,
catch errors before they produce some sort of unintended behavior and keep transparency & communication heightened across all teams.
Looking at the software development lifecycle through the lens of a DevOps Engineer will produce a more informed and qualified developer.

What is DevOps?
- DevOps is a new term emerging from the collision of two
major related trends. The first was also called “agile
infrastructure” or “agile operations”; it sprang from
applying Agile and Lean approaches to operations work.

- DevOps is “a cross-disciplinary community of practice
dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating
rapidly-changing resilient systems at scale.” - Jez Humble

- DevOps is a combination of software development and
information technology operations that enables
businesses to deliver applications at a faster pace. It
brings together development and operations teams so
there are fewer redundancies in the software
development process.
